# Engine01

This is an old codebase for a multithreaded procedural landmass generator and renderer. All 3D objects (terrain, trees, rocks) are generated at runtime.

It uses a few experimental (and dubious!) techniques for rendering land, water, and vegetation.
Most other graphics techniques present in the code are relatively old-school (e.g. classic Phong Illumination).

Current libraries used:
SDL2
DevIL
GLM
GLEW
